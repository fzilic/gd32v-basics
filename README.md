# gd32v-basics

A simple project used as a playground to build up some OO C++ apstraction layer around base C GD32V SKD.
Starting up with simple things like GPIO, SPI, some rudimentary APIs for working with screens I have around.

Hoping to have a working higher level abstraction for common use cases.

## Why do work myself?
Simple answer.

GD32V is a recent MCU and there is poor support from existing libraries for common frameworks.
I am not looking to implement stuff for Arduino or other libraries, but I am looking to have some fun, learn new language, find ways to optimize memory footprint.
There are some plans to use this, not just for fun.

Might look into porting some existing libraries to this base abstraction, as needed for whatever I build. Who know what will happen from there.
